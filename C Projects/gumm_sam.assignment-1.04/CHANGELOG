    Created initial method stubs
    Brainstormed a little bit
    Decided i hate VS codes autocorrect feature (where hitting enter accepts its suggestion)

    finally ported over other implementations from the previous assignments to make an actually functional product >_<

03/04:
    spent time getting the creational aspects up to snuff
    started taking a crack at the monsters
    decided eventually i need to clean things up

03/05:
    implemented new methods (event creation, monster creation...)
    starting to get ideas for my own final project
    just starting to warm up to C, and now we are moving on to C++ (T_T)
    Spent time getting everything to work
    finished! at roughly t-minus 2hrs
