Mar 25:
    - Figuring out how to link ncurses library
    - Current guideline from stackoverflow, need to replace with C-compliant one
       "CXX = g++ <--- gcc
        CXXFLAGS = -g -Wall -pedantic -Iinclude -std=c++17 -O2 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED <---- replace
        EXECUTABLE = game
        OBJECTS = main.o Character.o MC.o NPC.o Potion.o Game.o
        INC = ./src/include/  <--- replace with actual filepath
        SRC = $(shell find $(INC) -type f -name '*.cpp') <--- prolly can just remove
        LDFLAGS = -lncurses -lstdc++fs <--- only need -lncurses to link ncurses


        all:    compile run

        compile: $(OBJECTS) 
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $(EXECUTABLE) $(OBJECTS) $(LDFLAGS)

        doc: $(SRC)  <--- can get rid of
            doxygen

        run:
            ./$(EXECUTABLE)

        clean:
            rm $(EXECUTABLE) $(OBJECTS)


        main.o: ./src/main.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c ./src/main.cpp

        Character.o: $(INC)Character.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(INC)Character.cpp 

        NPC.o: $(INC)NPC.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(INC)NPC.cpp

        MC.o: $(INC)MC.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(INC)MC.cpp

        Potion.o: $(INC)Potion.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(INC)Potion.cpp

        Game.o: $(INC)Game.cpp
            $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(INC)Game.cpp"
    - marked methods that need proper descriptions (make it easier on me)
    - downloaded ncurses library
        -> linked it to the project through makefile
    - changed to a round-robin system for handling events
        -> having issues with the monsters moving to the pc and killing them instantly T_T
            -> want to evetually implement speed into this, maybe have monsters be able to take more than one move in a turn
            -> currently the heap event system, while technically working, kills the pc in one or two moves
                as either the pc goes first, and then the monsters each converge with multiple moves, or
                converge before the pc can move. not very fun...
    - finished implementing new methods to utilize ncurses
    - had some soju
    - maybe try to come up with a monster, that if on the floor, causes monsters NOT to attack each other?
