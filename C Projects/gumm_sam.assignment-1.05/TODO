### 1. Requirements Analysis

- **Understand the Core Tasks:**  
  - Integrate ncurses for an unbuffered, real‐time user interface.
  - Implement PC movement using both numeric (1–9) and vi/vim-style keys (h, j, k, l, etc.).
  - Enable staircase functionality that triggers dungeon regeneration when the PC uses stairs.
  - Display a monster list with relative positions and allow scrolling through it.
  - Reserve extra keys for future commands while ensuring the required ones are prioritized.

- **Decide on Dungeon Persistence:**  
  - Determine if levels should persist (so that returning via the opposite staircase recovers the same level) or be regenerated each time.

### 2. Environment Setup

- **Configure your Build Environment:**  
  - Link the ncurses library in your C project.
  - Ensure your development environment is set up to compile C code with ncurses support (e.g., using `-lncurses` when compiling).

- **Project Organization:**  
  - Consider splitting your project into modules (e.g., input handling, rendering, dungeon generation, game logic).

### 3. User Interface Design with Ncurses

- **Initialize Ncurses:**  
  - Set up ncurses with `initscr()`, enable unbuffered input with `cbreak()` and disable echo with `noecho()`.
  - Optionally, use `keypad(stdscr, TRUE)` to enable reading of special keys like arrow keys.

- **Screen Layout:**  
  - Reserve **line 0** for messages (debugging, command errors, etc.).
  - Use **lines 1–21** for the dungeon display.
  - Reserve the **bottom 2 lines** (lines 22–23) for status information.
  - Decide if you’ll create subwindows or manage everything in a single window with calculated coordinates.

### 4. Input Handling and Command Mapping

- **Real-Time Input:**  
  - Use ncurses functions (like `getch()`) to capture key presses without requiring Enter.
  - Immediately react to key events with the specified actions.

- **Key Mappings:**  
  - Implement the movement keys:
    - **Diagonal/Orthogonal Movement:**  
      - y/7: up-left  
      - k/8: up  
      - u/9: up-right  
      - l/6: right  
      - n/3: down-right  
      - j/2: down  
      - b/1: down-left  
      - h/4: left
  - Implement staircase commands:
    - `>`: attempt to go down (only if on a downward staircase).
    - `<`: attempt to go up (only if on an upward staircase).
  - Implement rest commands:
    - `5`, space, or `.`: rest for a turn.
  - Implement monster list display:
    - `m`: display the list with monster symbols and their positions relative to the PC.
    - Use arrow keys (up/down) for scrolling when needed, and `escape` to exit the monster list view.
  - Reserve the additional keys as specified for future features.

### 5. Game Logic and Dungeon Management

- **Movement and Interaction:**  
  - Update the PC’s position based on valid key inputs, ensuring moves respect walls, obstacles, or monsters.
  - Implement collision detection and interactions with the environment.

- **Staircase Functionality:**  
  - When a PC is on a staircase symbol (`<` or `>`), validate and process the appropriate command.
  - **Dungeon Generation:**  
    - If the PC uses the stairs, trigger a routine to generate a new dungeon level with fresh monster placements.
    - Decide if the new level should be saved for persistence (allowing a return to the same layout) or regenerated on each visit.
  - Optionally, decide if you will “connect” stairs (leaving the PC on an up staircase when coming back up).

### 6. Rendering and Display Updates

- **Efficient Redrawing:**  
  - Use ncurses routines to update only the changed portions of the screen (e.g., using `wrefresh()`).
  - Update the message line (line 0) with useful debugging or status messages (like "There’s a wall in the way!").

- **Status Information:**  
  - Update the bottom two lines with relevant game statistics, inventory status, or health information.

### 7. Additional Features and Enhancements

- **Optional Auto-Drive Mode:**  
  - If you want to retain the auto-drive code from last week, implement a toggle command to switch between manual and auto-drive.
  
- **Extra Command Implementations:**  
  - Consider implementing additional reserved commands (e.g., displaying inventory, character information, equipment, or distance maps) for future enhancements.
  - Ensure these extra commands do not conflict with the primary key mappings.

### 8. Testing and Debugging

- **Iterative Testing:**  
  - Test each command separately, verifying that movement, stairs, and UI updates work as expected.
  - Test edge cases (e.g., pressing keys when not on a staircase should have no effect, and invalid keys should be ignored).

- **User Feedback:**  
  - Use the message line to output error messages and confirmations, which will help during debugging.

- **Refactoring:**  
  - Once the core functionalities work, review your code for maintainability and potential modularity improvements.

### 9. Final Integration

- **Integration:**  
  - Integrate all modules (input handling, game logic, rendering) into a cohesive application.
  - Ensure that the overall user experience is smooth, with immediate command response and clear display updates.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Comment your code and document each module/function to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
