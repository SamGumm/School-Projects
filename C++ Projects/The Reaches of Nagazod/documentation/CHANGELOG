    Started:
        - created initial directories
        - settled on potential name -> "The Reaches of Nagazod" (very cool alliteration)
        - put some notes in about general artistic direction i guess

Apr 7:
    - it has been a while, remade files with new knowledge gained about cpp
    - still figuring out how to use OOP with C++
    - Made the monster class to play around with inheritance and polymorphism

Apr 25:
    - Remade everything, keeping core concept though
    - decided to go with manually made dungeon layouts initially
        - easier and better for story and testing
    - created the initial hpp files to drive the core of the game
        - dungeon
        - object
        - picture
        - player
        - room
        - save
        - screen
        - monster
    - leaning heavily on the OOP nasture of C++, which i like more
    - decided to go with a quad linked structure for the dungeon
        - rooms are a struct with 4 pointers (cardinal directions)
            - easier to alter later down the line
        - dungeon is the overall structure, consisting of a starting and ending room, and however many in-between
        - keeping things simple to start
    - fleshed out the beginnings of some classes 
        - Object and its derived classes
        - Room class
        - Dungeon class
    - refactored to increase performance (minusculely)
        - split large hpp files into hpp and cpp

Apr 26:
    - Added event tracking to rooms through boolean checks
    - Cleaned up code from yesterday
        - the mind slows down...

Apr 27:
    - Created BFS traversal for the dungeon
    - fleshed out Dungeon, basic implementation is done
    - Rooms can connect to each other
    - A dungeon is multiple rooms strung together
    -
