    Started:
        - created initial directories
        - settled on potential name -> "The Reaches of Nagazod" (very cool alliteration)
        - put some notes in about general artistic direction i guess

Apr 7:
    - it has been a while, remade files with new knowledge gained about cpp
    - still figuring out how to use OOP with C++
    - Made the monster class to play around with inheritance and polymorphism

Apr 25:
    - Remade everything, keeping core concept though
    - decided to go with manually made dungeon layouts initially
        - easier and better for story and testing
    - created the initial hpp files to drive the core of the game
        - dungeon
        - object
        - picture
        - player
        - room
        - save
        - screen
        - monster
    - leaning heavily on the OOP nasture of C++, which i like more
    - decided to go with a quad linked structure for the dungeon
        - rooms are a struct with 4 pointers (cardinal directions)
            - easier to alter later down the line
        - dungeon is the overall structure, consisting of a starting and ending room, and however many in-between
        - keeping things simple to start
    - fleshed out the beginnings of some classes 
        - Object and its derived classes
        - Room class
        - Dungeon class
    - refactored to increase performance (minusculely)
        - split large hpp files into hpp and cpp

Apr 26:
    - Added event tracking to rooms through boolean checks
    - Cleaned up code from yesterday
        - the mind slows down...

Apr 27:
    - Created BFS traversal for the dungeon
    - fleshed out Dungeon, basic implementation is done
    - Rooms can connect to each other
    - A dungeon is multiple rooms strung together

Apr 28:
    - switched stats from int to float to better fit calculation ideas
    - (mostly) decided on how combat will work
    - switched back to int stats T_T
    - got movement logic to work
    - got equipping to work
    - fleshed out player
    - made an object factory for unique objects to be placed in inventory
    - got the display methods down (for the most part)

Apr 29:
    - Its 2am T_T thinking about going to bed, but this monster energy is soo tempting
    - still need to get monster, room event, dice rolling, loot gen, encounter logic, end of lvl logic going
    - dont even want to think about getting ncurses up and rolling
        - panels are my archnemesis
    - main methods to finish most of this stuff are there.
    - already played around with panels in ncurses, just need to transfer (easier said than done)
    - so many projects, so little time...
    - we're so back
    - #pragma once ur my hero
    - gave up on multi-panel ncurses, much more complicated (and annoying) than I thought
    - switched to terminal-based loop for turn-in
    - threw together an encounter method
    - going through and adding descriptions and a readme now
