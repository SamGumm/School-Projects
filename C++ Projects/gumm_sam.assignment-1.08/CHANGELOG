Apr 14:
    - Went crazy on the refactoring
    - Decided to really lean into OOP methodolgy
    - Broke up lengthy methods into more manageable chunks
    - made placeholder classes for different objects
Apr 15:
    - Started filling out the methods
    - Still cannot figure out ncurses colors
    - gave up on ncurses colors
    - crazy that objects were previously optional but now are needed
Apr 16:
    - Kept working on the methods
    - finally got things to not crash, finished up most of the refactoring
    - officially moved mostly everything that i wanted to c++ from c
    - got the project to the point where i am turning this in, cannot take it anymore
    - still could not get ncurses colors to do anything
